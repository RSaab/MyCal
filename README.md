# MyCal

General Description

In our every day life activities, we have always been involved in organizing events and scheduling
meetings. Many calendar applications exist such as google calendar, coolender, and others.
However, you are special and require special features for your personal calendar. Now that you
have taken the computer networks course, you have decided to take matters into your own hands
and design a social calendar network application to fulll your needs. This calendar will be used
by others like yourself.
The main objectives of this project are to get familiar with socket programming using the
client/server model, to get exposed to network applications design and implementation, and to
get familiar with basic Java programming.
